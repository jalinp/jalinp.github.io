We LOVE tees! It's that simple and what's a better way to spread the message of love from Christ?  Everyone loves a good tee. Either to wear with jeans for an errand day or to dress it up with a dinner jacket and heels for the ladies or dress shoes for the fellas. Or maybe you wear tees to simply work out. 

Whatever you use them for they are comfy and relaxing as soon as you slip one on. They're a good conversation starter too. So, if you're visiting us, then you love Christ just as we do. Sometimes life can feel overwhelming but a good tee is like a snug hug.

We don't want to stop there. No way! The whole purpose of our tees is to spread love and the message of saving grace through Jesus Christ.  That's the heart of each message on each tee because we know the greatest mandate is to love God and to love your neighbor.  What better way to use your tee to hopefully start a conversation about Christ or serve as a gift of encouragement. 

Like we said; we LOVE tees and even more Jesus! So, whatever your purpose is we hope and pray that the message of hope and love is read not only from your tee but more importantly from your heart and your life!

May you have Beautiful Feet. {Romans 10:15}
